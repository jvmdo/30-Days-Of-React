1. What is HTTP request?

    An HTTP request is a message sent by a client to request data from a server. When a server receives an HTTP request, it processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, which includes the requested data and any additional information needed to display it properly in the client.

    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over the internet. It allows clients to request resources from a server and receive responses, regardless of the specific web services architectural style it was built on. However, the API must be designed to work with the HTTP protocol.

2. What are the most common HTTP requests?

    The most common API architecture is RESTful API, which implements the HTTP methods. The common ones are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE (because they represent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on resources)

3. What is fetch?

    `fetch API` is a built-in browser API to make HTTP requests.

4. What is axios?

    `axios` is a third-party library to make HTTP requests.

5. What is the difference between fetch and axios?

    Both has the same purpose, however `axios` is easier to use.

6. Do you prefer fetch to axios for make HTTP requests?

    It depends. For simple GET requests, I stick with fetch. For more complex ones, I'm with axios.
