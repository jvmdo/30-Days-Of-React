# Day 06 - List map and Keys
This is my answers and solutions for today's proposed exercises.

## Exercises: Level 1

1. Why you need to map an array ?
    - ```Array.prototype.map(fn)``` is a method that return another array containing the same number of elements, wherein each element is transformed by the callback function ```fn```.
    - In React, this method is very useful to create an array of JSX elements from an array on data.

2. Why we need keys during mapping an array ?
    - React needs to keep track each array's element because of performance issues. Because of that, each element must have its own unique identifier passed as the ```key``` parameter.

    - Destructuring makes code easier to understand since it explicitly shows which variables we need from an array/object.
